<p>By installing the floor first there will be no need for using trim moldings against toe kicks unless the floor itself is far out of whack. We have never had any issues with doing so. There is another reason you may want to go with cheap subflooring beneath those cabinets and counters. Read the instructions that came with the specific product you bought. Screw a strip of the same thickness to the floor next to the wall.</p>
