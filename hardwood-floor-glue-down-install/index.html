<p>Adding a vapor retarder is not required on installations over slabs with a calcium chloride reading of 3lbs or less a humidity reading of 75 or less or a calcium carbide CM rating of 25 or less. A glued-down wooden floor enhances the feel and sound of solid wood. However in on-grade and below-grade applications adding a vapor retarder is always recommended. Applications are more prominent with residential construction in sunbelt areas commercial locations and high-rise dwellings. The installation of hardwood floors by the glue down method is used predominately on concrete slabs.</p>
