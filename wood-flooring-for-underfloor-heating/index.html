<p>Electric underfloor heating systems work well with hardwood floors as wood conducts and holds the warmth produced by the floor heater and radiates this into the room. Unlike tiles or stone its naturally warm to the touch and provides better heat output than more insulating carpet materials. Floor heating can be used with different wood flooring types but attention must be paid to the thickness of the floor boards so that they do not act as an insulator blocking the heat. Your wood floor must be laid close to the subfloor and without an air gap as air gaps can cause the wood to dry out very quickly. As wood is a good insulator against heat engineered hardwood floors thickness and density can decrease the effectivity of underfloor heating.</p>

Yes this is possible and we have years of experience with installing parquet floors with undefloor heating. Engineered wood gives the same effect as solid hardwood but with the added benefits of strength and durability once it is laid. Floor heating can be used with different wood flooring types but attention must be paid to the thickness of the floor boards so that they do not act as an insulator blocking the heat. When laying a floor over underfloor heating loops the working temperature should be at least 18C.</p>
