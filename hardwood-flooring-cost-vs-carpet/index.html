What Are The Advantages Of Hardwood Over Carpet Living Room Hardwood Floors Carpet Carpet Flooring</p>
<p>Hardwood flooring would typically be better in modern homes looking to keep a contemporary aesthetic as well as rooms like the bathroom or the kitchen. For this reason hardwood flooring can be much more expensive than carpeting. However some of the higher-end options can cost even more. Laminate can run you between 1 and 10 per foot which is relatively similar to mid-range broadloom carpeting. While a carpeted floor will have a shorter lifespan it is also far cheaper when compared to hardwood floors.</p>
