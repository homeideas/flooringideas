<p>Knowing how to stain and seal a hardwood floor properly pays off in having a beautiful finish and enduring protection. As a general rule you should avoid letting stain sit on the surface of wood for more than 3 to 5 minutes. Work from one side of the room to the other frequently wringing out rag or sponge so coverage is even and stain doesnt pool on floor. Different wood species come with different natural characteristics. Apply the paste on the stain and let it dry.</p>
