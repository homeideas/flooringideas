One way to preserve the hardwood floor in your bathroom and enhance the interiors simultaneously is by installing perimeter surrounds for the bathtub or shower. Harder woods are often less porous.</p>

<p>I have nearly finished making a small table which will be placed in a bathroom. Now you can buy ceramic waterproof tiles that look exactly like the real thing. Dont rule out wood plank tiles in a small bathroom where they look fabulous. The only issue with wooden items and covers in bathrooms is that even with a special seal wood can get damaged easily bathrooms. If that is the case run your wood flooring in the same direction as the existing floor.</p>
