If you are installing a hardwood floating floor or any floating floor such as cork or laminate you should install the floor AFTER the kitchen cabinets are installed. When doing a kitchen project the first question that comes up is should the hardwood floors be installed before or after the cabinets.</p>

<p>Well as is always the best advice read the directions. If the cabinets are already installed then no. This saves you the hassle of measuring and reduces the risk of error. This hardwood is specifically stained and texturized to accent the Oaks wood grain pattern. If you are installing a hardwood floating floor or any floating floor such as cork or laminate you should install the floor AFTER the kitchen cabinets are installed.</p>

<p>However that does not mean that you should. It also saves you the hassle of cutting the planks of your hardwood flooring in exact measurements once the cabinets are installed. If this is a nail down floor run it under the cabs if its a floating floor install plywood that is 18 or 14 thicker than your flooring under the area where the cabs will go then install cabs first then the flooring the gap will be covered later by the toe-kick. You dont risk dragging a stove or heavy counter over the hardwoods and scratching or otherwise damaging them. Please note that this assumes that you are doing a full remodel in the kitchen both replacing the cabinets and the flooring at the same time.</p>
