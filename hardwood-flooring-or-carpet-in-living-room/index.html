<p>In are old house we had laminated floors and i hated them. Or if youre looking for a modern floor laminate might be the best choice. On the plus side carpet will mute noise and is warm underfoot. For example carpets are warmer than any other hard flooring options like wood vinyl linoleum and. In my rear living room i have wooden floors as the room has doors to the garden so when the dog comes in from when its been raining it is a lot easier to clean.</p>
