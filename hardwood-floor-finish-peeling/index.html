Here is what I found in my research. First off the reason why people say engineered floors look not real even though the top layer is actual wood is because most of them are constructed with rotary peel veneers. Peeling and adhesion problems are a direct result of not sanding before a coat of finish was applied or contanimates on the surface before the finish was applied. Based on that I went with solid hardwood floors.</p>

<p>I would almost describe it as bubbling up. To tell you the truth it may be 10 years of product coming off. It doesnt appear that the wood. Know what the current finish is. Im guessing you should sand the small area down to where the damage is gone while also providing mechanical bond for you to reapply finish.</p>

<p>Although it may not be a perfect repair it will be a lot cheaper and less work than refinishing the entire floor. I have some hardwood floors that I refinished 5 years or so ago. This is a situation where the finish releases from the wood floor or previous finish. Inadequate abrading or cleaning between finish coats applying a top coat over a floor that is not dry or working with incompatible finishes all can cause peelingThe best way to fix a peeling floor is to sand it down to bare wood and restart the finishing process. As you finish staining each section of floor wipe the floor with a clean rag to soak up any excess stain.</p>

<p>A loss of adhesion between the finish and the wood floor can result in the exposure of the bare wood previous coat of finish or the wood stain. Based on that I went with solid hardwood floors. Moisture issues can cause excessive wood swelling and increase the chances for delamination. A loss of adhesion between the finish and the wood floor can result in the exposure of the bare wood previous coat of finish or the wood stain. And the problem is is the top 3-millimeter layer is starting to peel up on a few of the boards.</p>

<p>It kind of looks like pulling up a piece of clear tape. I would almost describe it as bubbling up. If you do not abrade correctly the finish might not adhere and therefore peel off the surface.

<p>It doesnt appear that the wood. If you answered yes to any of these questions there is a good possibility you have your reason for a peeling floor. Expensive ones may give sawn veneers and those will look like hardwood. Theyre mostly holding up pretty well but around our breakfast bar the stools have taken up some of the varathane and have left damaged scuffed and peeling spots. You can see the seam its kinda yellowed and that is where the peeling begins and of course it follows the length of the boards.</p>
