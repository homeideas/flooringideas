<p>This is to remove the old door and install the new one. This would be a losing deal for Home Depot however most people are not looking for the cheapest carpet so a more typical price for a room that size would be around 270 carpet and pad. They also have the best clearance prices. I love Home Depot and Lowes for lots of things but I have seen them drive honest hardworking dealers out of business with their offers that always sound too good to be true. So you go to Home Depot.</p>

<p>However you need to consider the extra charges for incidental work. They are going to go the lowest bidder contractor in your area and then put their fee on top of it. With affordably-priced options across every imaginable floor type - hardwood tile vinyl carpet and more - youll get the products and the information you need for a successful installation. Not too long ago Lowes online store looked terrible. However you need to consider the extra charges for incidental work.</p>

<p>The basic installation price from either of these two box stores is around 380. Yes while they always require that you pay UPFRONT and IN FULL for the whole carpet job before they will place your carpet order the final bill comes on the day of installation when the independent installer determines that your job requires extra things like - hours of extra floor prep old carpet and padding removal or dump fees new flooring transitions custom upholstery work for stairs. Both of these companies offer a great range of products at prices that are competitive. Lowes comes in as a close second when it comes to buying your flooring online. Might work out great and it might not.</p>
