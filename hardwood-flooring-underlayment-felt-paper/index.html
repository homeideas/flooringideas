Flooring Over Plank Subfloor Engineered Wood Floors Flooring Plank</p>
<p>I was leaning toward a 30 black felt oiled paper to put over the original floor boards for a 34 solid hw install rather than a 15 black felt or the red rosin kraft paper. I was always taught that if you are laying wood floors on a first floor then you use felt paper if you are laying on a second floor then you could use red rosin if. Good idea or waste of money. Roofing paper has an asphalt coating which will emit petroleum fumes if used indoors. And NOT a reason to use a hardwood floor underlayment or wax paper.</p>

<p>This product looks like the same black paper as roofing paper but they are not the same. I was going to buy it in the roofing section of HD Thanks for any advice. Quick question re underlay for solid hardwood floors - it sounds like the two options are rosin paper red rosin paper. Richmonds everyday low price. Paper or felt are two materials that are traditionally installed between hardwood flooring and subfloor.</p>

<p>The paper is installed just before the wood flooring and comes in rolls of various lengths. Also can you put tar paper under laminate flooring. The paper is installed just before the wood flooring and comes in rolls of various lengths. Tar paper or roofing felt are often used as flooring underlayment. Floating engineered wood floors or solid-hybrid floors will use a padded underlayment such as Floor Muffler while nail-down hardwood use paper underlayment such as Aquabar-B or Silicone Vapor Sheild.</p>
