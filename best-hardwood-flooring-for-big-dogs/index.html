Oak and hickory are both good choices. You have to accept SCRATCHES to be able to live with a hardwood floor. If you use solid wood you can always change the color when you refinish so if youve always longed for a deep dark wood floor you can have it once the kids are away at college.</p>

<p>Yes hardwood floors and large dogs can coexist in your home. The Janka hardness rating of the hard maple hardwood flooring species is about 1450. Lacquered wood flooring is extremely easy to maintain as the sealed finish means most spills and stains sit on the surface of the flooring and only require a damp cloth to remove them. Lighter floors are the best hardwood floors for dogs and cats as they hide pet hair better while dark floors reveal scratches and hair from shedding pets far more obviously. If you expect perfect for 25 years then porcelain tiles are your best bet.</p>
