<p>Cork flooring can also help you save money on heating and cooling bills. Cork flooring is also very durable which is a big benefit in the kitchen as it is probably the most traveled room in the entire house. As it does with small scratches the highly textural pattern of cork helps mask light stains and marks. Cork might just be the current darling when it comes to flooring particularly in the kitchen. Its unlike any other floor that Ive stepped on.</p>
