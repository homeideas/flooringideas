<p>Each has its advantages but the success of either method will depend on the size and length of the nails or staples that are used. Concrete or other hardboard type subfloor materials will not hold staples or nails. Adapters are required when nailing hardwood flooring planks less than 34 thick. Failure to heed this vital prerequisite will lead to spongy creaking and popping sounds. On light weight concrete or gypsum floors like you have in a condo or apartment floating your floor may be your only option depending on the softness and porosity of the subfloor.</p>

<p>On light weight concrete or gypsum floors like you have in a condo or apartment floating your floor may be your only option depending on the softness and porosity of the subfloor. The Cons of Using Staples. Die cut floor nails are sharper thus less likely to break the tongue of your hardwood floor on entry. Staples are familiar to DIY fans and building box stores often push this method of installation. However flooring staples are more likely to back out as wood expands and contracts loosening the hold and increasing the risk of squeaks.</p>

<p>Staples are also more likely to split the tongue of the flooring especially flooring less than 34 in. The process involves nailing the flooring directly to a wood subfloor. Concrete or other hardboard type subfloor materials will not hold staples or nails. This is particularly important on very brittle hardwoods like the exotic species ie. Using a pneumatic tool staples are used to secure hardwood flooring to a plywood subfloor.</p>

<p>The process involves nailing the flooring directly to a wood subfloor. The regular nails do not have the holding power to keep the wood from moving. Staples are familiar to DIY fans and building box stores often push this method of installation. Adapters are required when nailing hardwood flooring planks less than 34 thick. With staples youll also have to nail in through the face thereby leaving marks all over the floor and ruining the appearance.</p>
