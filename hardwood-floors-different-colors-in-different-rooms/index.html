Go In Two Different Directions Laminate Flooring Two Rooms Meet Wood Floors Wide Plank Flooring Hardwood Floors</p>
<p>Perhaps a compromise would be to install a border with the dark cherry stain and still use the maple. Ask for samples of every floor youre considering and bring them home to see how they look with the existing hardwood or in the proposed room. This is the very opposite of the consistency and flow gained by using matching or the same materials. Using different color wood floors in house interior design is a great starting point for stamping a separate personality on different rooms or areas. But the furniture you select either magnifies or diminishes this effect.</p>
