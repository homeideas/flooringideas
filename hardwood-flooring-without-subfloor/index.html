<p>Floating sub floors for solid hardwood installations generally consist of two layers of plywood or allowing enough wood for a 1 ½ inch flooring cleat to hold effectively. This is where the contractor made a joke see 9. If you have a dehumidifier that collects water in a room that has hardwood floors make sure you empty it frequently so that the water will not overflow. You can take it as a DIY project. If replacement isnt an option but your floors are still good for another sanding theres only one chance to get it right.</p>

<p>The floors are very squeaky and definitely feel spongy in many spots despite being ostensibly nailed down. A homemade wood floor polish will effectively restore the gloss of your aging wood floor without any toxic side effects. Besides all the other benefits underlay helps support a floating floor. If youre installing laminate or engineered flooring that snaps together and floats over the subfloor without nails you need underlayment even more. First empty the floor by removing all furniture.</p>
