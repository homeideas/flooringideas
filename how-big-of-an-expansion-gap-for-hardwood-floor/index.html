<p>What is an expansion gap. It is an essential gap that must be left around the edge of the room when fitting hardwood bamboo or laminate flooring. It is not absolutely necessary to remove baseboards to install new hardwoods but remember that wood floors require an expansion gap of 12 inch along the surrounding walls to accommodate expansion and contraction with changes in moisture and humidity. If you cant find a solid recommendation then use 12 for the maximum protection - and if the trim you install doesnt cover the gap use quarter. The recommended expansion gap is a minimum of ¼ inch.</p>

<p>The ideal humidity level is 30 percent to 50 percent and the ideal temperature range is 60 to 80 degrees. In most cases the perimeter expansion gap is related to the thickness of the new flooring. All the wood in your home will expand or contract as moisture in the air changes. Wood movement can ruin a seemingly well-constructed project. This is a great fix for any narrow gaps that start to form in your flooring.</p>
