<p>To inspire a home renovation or a kitchen makeover weve rounded up some beautiful kitchens with hardwood floors. Inspiration for a large modern l-shaped light wood floor and brown floor open concept kitchen remodel in Miami with an undermount sink recessed-panel cabinets gray cabinets granite countertops beige backsplash ceramic backsplash stainless steel appliances and an island. Nuanced grey tones can be brought in through concrete work surfaces or a beautiful lime plaster finish on the walls like the one that interior designer Mark Lewis has created in a converted gothic church. Darker gray shades are the ideal backdrop for intense bold color accents such as red for example while lighter grey hues work extremely well in grey and white bedroom ideas with yellow pink and natural wood. Beneath the top coat glued to the sturdy core is a thin veneer of real wood which makes engineered wood flooring almost like the real deal except its much more durable.</p>
