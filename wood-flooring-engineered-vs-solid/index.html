<p><strong>Wood Flooring Engineered Vs Solid</strong>, Solid wood floors are slightly more expensive than an engineered wood flooring but if you are a diehard wood flooring enthusiast then you may want to stick with a solid hardwood flooring. Solid hardwood is generally more costly because of the amount of solid wood that is used for each plank of flooring. If you have a tight budget for your floor then engineered hardwood usually works out more cost effective than solid.</p>

Solid hardwood offers more flexibility longevity and durability while stable engineered floors are more suitable for humid locations and installations against concrete slabs. Solid hardwood flooring can be screened and refinished more frequently than the thinner veneer of engineered wood flooring.</p>
<h3 id="with-an-engineered-timber-floor-you-can-create-much-wider-planks-exposing-more-of-the-woods-natural-textures">With an engineered timber floor you can create much wider planks exposing more of the woods natural textures.</h3><p>However engineered timber floors can have wider floorboards over 100mm wide because theyre more stable than solid wood floors. Either way both products will provide a luxurious and polished finish to your space. Engineered floors today have a wear layer that is as thin as 5 mm and up. There is no other wood mixed whereas engineered hardwood also known as a floating floor refers to timber that has been made up of various layers lower grade. Engineered hardwood flooring is done in layers.</p>

<p>But the most critical factor to deciding between solid or engineered is the type of home you live in where your home is located and your preferences as to the performance of your floor from season to season. Its hard to find a solid timber floorboard thats any wider than 100mm purely because the wider and thicker the board is the harder it is to keep it from expanding. The difference between a solid wood floor board and a good quality engineered floor board that has a minimum top layer thickness of 4mm or 6mm is minimal. Engineered wood flooring on the other hand is made up of cleverly constructed core boards that are effectively layers and layers of ply that are bonded together. Because it is solid all the way through solid hardwood flooring can be sanded and refinished several times giving a new lease of life each time and therefore a longer lifespan.</p>

<p>Solid boards are normally 18mm thick and good quality engineered wood flooring is 20 to 21mm thick. This means that engineered timber floorboards can actually bring out more of the natural texture and beauty of wood. They want wider boards longer lengths or both. There is no other wood mixed whereas engineered hardwood also known as a floating floor refers to timber that has been made up of various layers lower grade. Plus its easy to install over radiant heat hence less expansion and contraction.</p>

Hardwood Vs Laminate Vs Engineered Hardwood Floors What S The Difference Engineered Hardwood Flooring Hardwood Floors Flooring</p>
<p>Additionally engineered floors are more appropriate for people with a slightly lower budget or for those who would prefer a simple quick installation as this.

<p>You may be surprised that what may appear as solid wood is actually engineered wood. There is no other wood mixed whereas engineered hardwood also known as a floating floor refers to timber that has been made up of various layers lower grade.

As the name implies solid hardwood is solid wood all the way through.</p>
