There are quite a few people who advise against installing a hardwood floor in a bathroom citing primarily the potential problems that moisture can cause. Do not consider solid wood flooring for most bathrooms. And yes wood flooring in the bathroom is risky. While engineered wood does have real wood layers at the top you have to ensure it is fully sealed as well.</p>

If so at least one naysayer has probably already tried to steer you toward different types of flooring. What you may not realize is their ability to withstand humid conditions as well. I am often asked is it safe to install wood floors in the bathrooms of our house The answer is yes and no.</p>
