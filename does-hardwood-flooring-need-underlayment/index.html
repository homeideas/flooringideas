<p>In this case the underlayment does not need to be nailed to the subfloor but the hardwood planks will be nailed down to the underlayment. The underlayment provides many benefits including moisture protection sound and thermal insulation and a cushion to make the floor more comfortable to walk on. The species of hardwood flooring and the specific needs of the room affect the quality of your underlayment. Your using solid on wood so as you said just nail it. I have a heated insulated basement with duct work running along the ceiling and I want to.</p>

To keep the black coloring of the rubber from staining the hardwood. For example a 2mm Polyfoam Underlay is recommended for a chipboard sub-floor but is barely going to provide any sound deadening and has no moisture barrier. Does wood flooring need underlay. Your using solid on wood so as you said just nail it.</p>
