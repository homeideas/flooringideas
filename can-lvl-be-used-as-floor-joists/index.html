Manufactured from LVL and oriented strand board OSB e-joist has a similar strength as a solid LVL beam of the same size but uses much less wood making it lighter and easier to handle. The wood boards used as floor joists generally range in size from no smaller than 2-by-4 inches to no larger than 2-by-12 inches. Current floor is Yellow Tongue Particle Board supported by Oregon floor joists 200 x 50 450c the actual floor joist vary in height between 210mm 195mm. LVL beams are dead straight which was a big advantage on this project compared to glulam beams that usually have a crown.</p>

<p>All of the components are engineered to the industrys highest standards to help contractors build. In that case you need something like a 12-16 GLULAM or LVL to span the 20 and can use simple 2x8-10 dimensional lumber 16OC as floor joists. Only thing i use lvls for is stair stringers it is nice having perfectly straight runs that are still strong after cutting out the notches and as a bonus it is very difficult to blow out one of the keys and having the square edge is nick also. How far can you span a 212 LVL. If you are able find lumber that is the same width as your LVL joist.</p>

<p>The three main types of floor joists used in home construction are solid lumber I-joists and open-web floor trusses. In that case you need something like a 12-16 GLULAM or LVL to span the 20 and can use simple 2x8-10 dimensional lumber 16OC as floor joists. Only thing i use lvls for is stair stringers it is nice having perfectly straight runs that are still strong after cutting out the notches and as a bonus it is very difficult to blow out one of the keys and having the square edge is nick also. LVL beams are dead straight which was a big advantage on this project compared to glulam beams that usually have a crown. Now for floor joists.</p>
