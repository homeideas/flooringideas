Oil Vs Water Based Polyurethane Which Is Better For Refinishing Wood Cheap Hardwood Floors Flooring Trends Refinishing Hardwood Floors</p>
<p>A polyurethane hardwood floor finish can preserve the installations visual appeal but it can be hard to know how to choose between water-based and oil-based varieties. The most notable difference between the two types is simply the appearance of the wood after the final coat. I recommend making a list of the qualities and characteristics that are most important to you then use the comparison above as a guide to help you make the right decision. Theres debate over which finish is harder but some experts maintain that hardness isnt necessarily a good attribute of a floor finish. Popping is a process used to open up the grain of wood flooring.</p>
