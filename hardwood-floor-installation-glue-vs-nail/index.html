<p>Feel and sound is a consideration in that nailed and glued down installations tend to sound a little more solid and will have very little movement when you walk across the floor. The glue down method involves using adhesives to adhere the hardwood flooring to the subfloor. So when the plank width demands assistance from glue the natural inclination is to use as little as possible just throw down a few beads as added security and let the nails do most of the work. Insert the spline and fasten the piece with the floor nailer. Im not aware of solid hardwood product available as a click flooring.</p>

<p>A glue down hardwood is the most expensive form of hardwood install we have. The glue down method involves using adhesives to adhere the hardwood flooring to the subfloor. The glue-down method is commonly used in slab construction because it allows the flooring to be attached directly to a concrete slab. Remove your backer board. Continue the installation in the other direction until there is insufficient space to use the floor nailer.</p>
