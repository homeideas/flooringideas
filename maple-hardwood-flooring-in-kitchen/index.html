<p>If youve decided to add hardwood flooring to your home as well there are several hardwood flooring shades that will coordinate or contrast with the maple cabinets well to create a space that fits your decorative preferences. However this makes maple floor durable harder than oak and less prone to denting. Most modern hardwood floor planks fit together in a tongue and groove fashion. A little bit of wood or wicker is always pretty in a white kitchen and its also true that what makes a light oak or maple kitchen just right is lots of crisp white. Wood floors are often used in kitchens to give them a warm cozy feel and using a light maple that matches the cabinets for the flooring creates a unified feel for the space.</p>
