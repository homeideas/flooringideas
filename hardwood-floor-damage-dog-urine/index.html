<p>Training a young puppy or kitten also can result in having stinky pet urine stains on your floors. These include urine and poop stains. Wood is a porous material and so the liquid will penetrate it easily. Though a good polyurethane seal on your floors is the best defense against urine stains and surface scuffs it cant fully protect the wood. However the stinky dog urine stuck on hardwood floors can get worse in time.</p>
