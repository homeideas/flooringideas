<p>So if you choose this option colors and grains are preserved. Ebony cherry live oak or bamboo are the most durable choices.

Since bamboo is basically a fast-growing grass making it into a wear-resistant flooring material requires a considerable transformation. Bruce hardwoods finish out my top 5 list with its distinct oak and hickory floors sold across the country in various stores.</p>
