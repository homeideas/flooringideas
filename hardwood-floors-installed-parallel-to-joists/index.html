<p>This is new construction. Can we safely install 34 hardwood running parallel to joists. Lay the flooring in the direction of the longest dimension of the room or building across or right angles to the joists Some problems encountered when flooring is installed. What you have with 58 is not near adequate or stable enough to support you floor and everything else you will put on it. I will be soon laying my 34 prefinished strip maple flooring.</p>

<p>I think the flooring company wanted a minimum 34 subfloor before they would install parallel but dont quote me on that. Hardwood flooring must be installed perpendicular to the floor joists or on a diagonal for any single layer subfloor. I want to install nail-down 34 solid hardwood flooring and they would logically go along the longer side of the rooms and be parallel to the floor joists. Apart from a few exceptions like sagging joists this is the preferred direction to lay wood floors because it provides the best result aesthetically. If youre installing hardwood floor boards over a strong 34 inch plywood sub-floor then yes you can install the hardwood floor parallel to the joists.</p>
