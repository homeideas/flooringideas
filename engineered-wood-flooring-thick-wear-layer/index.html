<p>There is a large range of thickness available from 06mm to 4mm. The general and obvious rule is that the thicker the wear layer the more times it can be sanded and refinished. Most people do not think an engineered floor can be refinished as many times as a solid hardwood floor. The wear layer on most engineered wood is incorporated into the planks real wood veneer layer and ranges from 3mm 5mm thick. For an engineered hardwood the most desired thickness can be anywhere from 12- 58 thick.</p>

<p>The rotary peel method creates a thin layer and is characterized by a cathedral grain pattern. Again depending on texture you can rely on 3-4 re-sandings. Our second engineered wood floor is 6 millimeters 023622 inch of wear layer. So when it comes down to the notion that solid is better than engineered. Thicker top layers can be sanded just like solid wood allowing you to erase deeper scratches and dents.</p>
