<p>There are many varieties of engineered wood flooring on the market and they vary a great deal in quality and durability. We select all of our wide plank wood floors directly from the best timber mills to ensure the very highest quality. In most cases the wider planks tend to cost more than narrower planks. The main reason for this is because the wider planks are made from older growth trees which are more valuable. Few products are as cherished as our wide plank oak flooring.</p>
