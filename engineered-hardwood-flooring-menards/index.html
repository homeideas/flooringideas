Pin On For The Home</p>
<p>I purchased a product from menards made by great lakes flooring company. Very Unsatisfied 1 out of 5 Review. Neither GLWF nor Menards stands behind warranty. Cons Finding boards that lock together requires a lot of searching making installation of this flooring very frustrating. I have done 2 floors before and i wanted in my new house to do engineered hardwood on the first floor.</p>
