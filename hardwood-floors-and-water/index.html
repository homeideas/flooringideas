It would be pointless to repair the wood if you dont seal the leak or fix the pipes from where the water is coming. You can add a few drops of essential oils for cleaning to the vinegar and water if you choose to.</p>

<p>Hardwood floors do have a weakness. Manufacturers and industry experts advise against cleaning hardwood floors with water because wood naturally expands when its wet and can cause your floor to crack or splinter. Properly finished engineered hardwoods are water-resistant but they are not waterproof. Using vinegar and water as a homemade hardwood floor cleaning solution can have a negative effect on your hardwood floor. The sooner you can attend to your wet floors the better.</p>
