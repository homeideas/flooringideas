<p>Engineered hardwood flooring can be used in almost any space except for those with high-moisture and humidity ie. Bamboo flooring is a great eco-friendly and hard wearing alternative to hardwood flooring. Engineered hardwood floors are suitable for installation on all levels of the home and over plywood wood OSB and concrete subfloors. Additionally bamboo is termite resistant and comes in a huge choice of stains and plank widths. Whether to choose solid or engineered bamboo may be a question you are thinking about.</p>

Its a common misconception that engineered flooring is a low budget product made to get by with less hardwood. Thanks to new construction techniques as you do not need thick floor anymore as part of your house structure. Its very durable as several layers are bonded together.</p>
