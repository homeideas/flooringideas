<p>Because of the way engineered flooring is constructed it is far more resistant to the expansion and contraction that occurs with solid wood planks. The major difference between the hardwood and engineered wood flooring is that the hardwood flooring consists of a single layer of hardwood cut and placed for acting as a floor.

It is important to select the right type of flooring according to the needs and requirements of the area in question. The planks are nailed to the subfloor through the tongue so the nails dont show when the floor is completed. The main difference between engineered and solid wood flooring is in the construction of the planks.</p>
