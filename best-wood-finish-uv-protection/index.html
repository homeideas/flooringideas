<p>Exterior finishes that dont contain these UV absorbers still work well in shaded areas. As already mentioned the varnishes that provide UV protection darken the wood considerably and also somewhat obscure. Practical sailor posted a long term test a while back and Epiphanes wood finish gloss came out as one of the most uv resistant as well as having excellent gloss retention. It also protects wooden surfaces against UV damage and prevents the formation of mold mildew and fungus. This transparent stain wont cover over the natural beauty of cedar fences but keep in mind that it is lightly pigmented to provide UV protection.</p>

<p>Preserva Wood Cedar Exterior Stain and Sealer is a great option for a cedar fence stain. Wood finishes are messy and old-school polyurethane is a MESS to put on and wait a day to dry. Exterior finishes generally go by the name spar as in spar varnish Sometimes a distinction for UV resistance can be made between common spar finishes without UV inhibitors and marine or boat finishes with UV inhibitors. Nothing blocks UV rays better than pigments. Practical sailor posted a long term test a while back and Epiphanes wood finish gloss came out as one of the most uv resistant as well as having excellent gloss retention.</p>

<p>Exterior finishes that dont contain these UV absorbers still work well in shaded areas. SEAL-ONCE MARINE Wood Sealer Waterproofer. Bamboogle Food Grade Mineral Oil for Wood. Thompsons Water Seal VOC Wood Protector. The deck stains that provide the best UV protection are heavily pigmented and basically opaque paint that completely obscures the wood.</p>
