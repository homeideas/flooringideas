Well offer an explanation for both situations which impact the health risks of coming into contact with aluminum oxide so you can determine whether it affects you or not. In looking at the samplesthis finish seems to have a waxy or plastic look to it unless you are standing directly on top.</p>

Coffee Reflector With Urethane Mixed With Aluminum Oxide To Make A Satin Finish Flooring Hardwood Floors Reflectors</p>
<p>Take special care not to damage this coating when cleaning the floor. On the plus side they are more resilient to stains than oil finish floors. Aluminum oxide finishes are designed to add a layer of scratch resistance. Earlier versions of the finish saw applications on the top surface but complaints of roughness moved manufacturers to a sandwich type application where the aluminum oxide was applied more to the center layers of the finishing process. Since there are essentially metal particles although they arent visible since theyre very small in your wood floors finish its extremely durable.</p>
