<p>Just to ensure you consider all of your options here are a few reasons against using hardwood in the kitchen. While hardwood floors in living areas may be finished with various traditional penetrating oils kitchen floors typically need a surface finish such as polyurethane that completely seals the wood surface to prevent penetration from water and staining agents and creates a highly washable surface.

It is lovely to look at timeless in design and easy to refinish whenever styles change.</p>
