<p>The transition between different types of wood flooring in two adjoining rooms occurs in a straight line within the threshold of the room. Max flooring deviation at transitions. The longer the boards the more visually appealing your floor. Called seam binders these wide about 5 inches transition strips are flat and bridge two wood floors of equal heights. An easy and quick way to transition neatly is using a piece of T-molding.</p>

<p>For this job all you need is a bevel tool and a saw. Nice pictures really helps me I would consider a darker hardwood border the rooms then set the center on 45 degree to the hall. If your set on tile the transition is simple you carpeted rooms will need proper subfloor so the height should be almost perfect if not very close then its just a t-mold stained same as entry. For various size of floors in various areas there are different ideas that I might share to you. Your design can include pairing almost anything including wood next to marble or even a combination of porcelain and ceramic tile.</p>
