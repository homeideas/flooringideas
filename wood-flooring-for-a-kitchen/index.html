<p>These finished hardwood floors require less maintenance. With this installation the boards butt up tightly together and are covered with a sealer coat that covers the entire surface providing protection that wont be penetrated by water or staining materials. Wood floors in the kitchen maintain consistency in a home with an open floor plan where the hardwood flooring is used in adjoining areas. In my opinion they are both great options. Linoleum was in vogue and ordinary hardwood posed too many problems from possible water damage to lack of resistance to dings and scratches.</p>
