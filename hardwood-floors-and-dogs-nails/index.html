<p>To make your floors even more scratch-resistant we recommend having a tough finish applied to the hardwood. Dark hardwood floors do not hide these scratches and they are also very hard to fix if your dogs ever scratch them. Wood floors and dogs dont always mix. And since declawing a pooch is never a good option you need to adjust the floor to the dog not the dog to the floor. Its just a matter of when.</p>
