Perfect Removing Glued Engineered Wood Flooring From Subfloor And View Engineered Wood Floors Engineered Hardwood Flooring Engineered Hardwood</p>
<p>The term floating hardwood floor refers to the method of installation. Engineered hardwood products may be fastened stapled or glued on above or below grade. All Junckers wooden floors can be bonded to any dry level and solid subfloor such as concrete screed or wooden materials. In this hardwood floor installation video we show you how to Install Hardwood Flooring Over Tile Floor Double Glue Down Method with underlayment. Gluing down your hardwood floor includes pros like giving your floors a solid feel and sound as well as being least likely to have deflection between flooring and subflooring.</p>

<p>With a glued down or nailed down hardwood floor each plank is fastened directly to the subfloor and not to the adjacent plank so when one plank expands it does not necessarily affect the others planks. So fixing it again down to the substrate rather than installing in a floating way would have no adverse effects. Less expensive than the glue down alternative due to less installation time and minimal adhesive cost. Tearing up hardwood floors that have been glued direct to concrete will be an extremely messy and labor intensive job. My answer to that is yes and it is still warranted.</p>
