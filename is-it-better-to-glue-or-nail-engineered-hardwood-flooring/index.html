<p>Engineered flooring All grades especially below grade Good for cement subfloors. In any such case glued floors or floating floors could probably be the best choice. Many homeowners are concerned that adhesives have odor and off-gassing issues. Finally if you need your room back to normal quickly then because of the drying time of glue-down nail-down will work better for you. If the surface underneath the hardwood flooring is wood then nails will work just fine.</p>

<p>If the surface underneath the hardwood flooring is wood then nails will work just fine. When you have solid hardwood 5 or more you should add in some gluestrip the floor in addition to nail but that is not required for engineered. If its concrete however gluing is a better option. Also some adhesives act as acoustic barrier and some as moisture retardant. I chose a good hardwood engineered floor for a game room approx 400 sqft on an wood subfloor is it better to nail down or glue down and what is best glue for concrete for any engineered woof floor is bostiks best urethane wood glue not fun to work with but the best by far a real solid hardwood float flooring vs glued flooring vs nail-down.</p>

<p>Other cons include it requiring extra tools like the right type of nail gun jamb saw and router. On light weight concrete or gypsum floors like you have in a condo or apartment floating your floor may be your only option depending on the softness and porosity of the subfloor. In any such case glued floors or floating floors could probably be the best choice. The adhesive approach is generally used when installing over concrete. Also some adhesives act as acoustic barrier and some as moisture retardant.</p>
