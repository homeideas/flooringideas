<p>The best option for bathroom wood flooring is engineered wood flooring because of its layered core giving it extra stability and protection against humidity and temperature changes. There are a lot of different species of wood that can be used in flooring. Engineered hardwood flooring is hands-down a safer bet for bathrooms. Wood is extremely popular for bathroom décor. So using hardwood flooring in a bathroom will sooner or later force you to deal with mold and mildew.</p>

<p>Wood is extremely popular for bathroom décor. Engineered hardwood flooring is dimensionally stable and therefore does not fluctuate too much in response to humidity so its generally best to go with engineered floors instead of solid wood. Installing a solid hardwood floor in a bathroom is not recommendedDue to the large difference in air humidity during and after you take a shower as well as the contact of water directly on the wooden floor problems arise with the expansion. This is your first line of defense and it will need to be reapplied every few months. Lay an engineered floor over under floor heating for a warm and cosy bathroom.</p>
