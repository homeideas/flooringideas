<p>Dark woods tend to show wear and tear pet hair and dirt more readily than lighter color floors. A wired brushed floor also makes the floor stronger because the softer wood is scraped away. In kitchens hardwood makes for a slightly more comfortable flooring surface than harder materials such as stone or ceramic tile but it is considerably harder than more resilient flooring materials such as vinyl or cork. Each sheen has its appropriate place in your home but theres one style we recommend the most for kitchens. Larger tile sizes remain popular as they have in previous years.</p>

<p>These finished hardwood floors require less maintenance. Larger tile sizes remain popular as they have in previous years. Concrete and resin flooring is a possibility for ground-floor kitchens but will not be suitable for upstairs kitchens. Our In-House oils and finishes work great in. For 2021 tiles continue to be popular as kitchen flooring.</p>
