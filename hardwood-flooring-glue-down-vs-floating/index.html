<p>Whats more many newer types of glue are elastomeric meaning they will facilitate expansion and contraction of the wood but wont let them shrink or grow to the extent possible if the planks were nailed down or floating. Gluing down the hardwood floors is highly effective to resist the moisture etc. Engineered hardwood floors can be glued or nailed into position but they also have the option of being floated over an underlay. Another bonus of glued-down engineered hardwood flooring. Solid hardwood floors must be fixed into position by either gluing or nailing down to the subfloor.</p>
