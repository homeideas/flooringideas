Yes you can install just about any type of flooring over a radiant heat system but I would not recommend any type of vinyl flooring. Many homeowners now wish to replace their old ceramic tile with laminate flooring.</p>

Pin On What The</p>
<p>Sorry the answer is no. The floor is secured via the base molding. 1 Nail down requires plywood sub-flloor you cant nail into concretelast I checked 2. It is easier to install right over outdated ceramic tile than it is to remove it. With all that said although you can add New Wood Flooring over the old one the answer is YES.</p>

Pin On Flooring</p>
<p>Wood laminate flooring has grown exponentially in popularity over the last few years for several reasons. With the proper substrate you can install vinyl flooring over. Moisture can pose problems for solid hardwood floors below ground level so engineered wood floors made of layers of wood glued together are the best choice there. It provides the warm look of hardwood flooring at a fraction of the cost. Sorry the answer is no.</p>
