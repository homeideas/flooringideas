The Best Installing Timber Flooring Over Tiles And View Flooring Timber Flooring Parquet Flooring</p>
<p>That being said a wood floor over tile is not a bad option if you dont want to remove the old floor. Yes you can lay engineered-wood or laminate flooring over tile if the tile is in decent shape. I would suggest 38 thick prefinished engineered hardwood flooring. As you can see the tiles came up with little of the thinset mortar still attached to the floor. If it is damaged and not consistent in height it will only cause problems for your new flooring such as creaking hollowness and uneven planks.</p>
