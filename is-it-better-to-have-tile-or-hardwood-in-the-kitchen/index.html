<p>Similarly is it better to have tile or hardwood in the kitchen. Its ok for your hardwood floors to be scratched that is what real life does. They also go particularly well with dark blue cabinets as seen in photos 3 and 5. In kitchens hardwood makes for a slightly more comfortable flooring surface than harder materials such as stone or ceramic tile but it is considerably harder than more resilient flooring materials such as vinyl or cork. Wood-look tile keeps costs lower.</p>

<p>Hardwood can ruin when exposed to moisture and in a high-humidity area like a kitchen. Tile is colder requires more maintenance and is often more expensive. With hardwood you might be smelling remnants of pickles for weeks to come. When I look back now it all felt choppy to me. Wood-look flooring is easy to clean so you dont have to worry about the stains scratches chips and dents that can result from poorly maintained hardwood floors.</p>
