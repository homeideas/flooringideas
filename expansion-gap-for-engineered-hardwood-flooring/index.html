Kahrs Solid Wood Threshold Trim Wood Engineered Wood Floors Wood Laminate</p>
<p>Although engineered hardwood floors can withstand changes in temperature and moisture better than solid wood floors they still need an expansion gap to allow for small movements. Allow this normal movement in all installations by providing the recommended side or perimeter expansion gap or spacing per product. The gaps affect probably 20 of the entire. However engineered wood flooring like other types of flooring also needs an expansion gap. Many people recommend the best way to fix engineered wood flooring is with secret nails - in which case the nails would come loose and the flooring would get damaged if it did expand.</p>
