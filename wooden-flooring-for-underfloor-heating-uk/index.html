The temperature controls should be accurate as the floor temperature mustnt exceed 27 degrees. For instance youll need to keep the heating system working for a longer time and at warmer temperatures to get the same results that youd get with other types of flooring. And keep the relative humidity RH in every room between 45 at the low-end and 60 at the high-end.</p>

<p>In a cold dry climate you can expect to see gaps between strips and slightly concave boards from time to time. The engineered wood flooring needs to be glued down with a full surface bond not lines of glue using a flexible flooring adhesive to allow the floor to expand and contract as the temperature generated by the underfloor heating rises and falls. Partnering with a quality underfloor heating and wooden floor installation company is the easiest way to avoid any moisture-related issues. Thanks to advancements in wooden flooring it is possible to use underfloor heating alongside it. We recommend Kährs Original 15 mm parquet flooring or Kährs Linnea 7 mm with Woodloc or Woodloc 5S joints for floors with underfloor heating.</p>
