<p><strong>Wood Floor Thickness Underfloor Heating</strong>, Wood flooring manufactured and expected to perform at MC levels higher than 9 percent or in conditions above 50 percent RH should not be used with radiant heating systems. Just like engineered wood flooring the maximum underfloor heating temperature for laminate flooring is 27 degrees Celsius.

<p>The board manufacturer states its compatible with UFH but some sites say the boards should not be more than 16mm thick another site says less than 22mm thick but with a board thickness to. The thickness and density of hardwood flooring can impact on the performance of the system and we. As wood is a good insulator against heat engineered hardwood floors thickness and density can decrease the effectivity of underfloor heating. We recommend using engineered wood floorboards with our underfloor heating systems due to their strong structural design. Wooden flooring is an excellent material to install on top of any underfloor heating system due to its warm feel and excellent thermal properties.</p>

<p>Underfloor heating systems are available for all types of wood floors. We recommend using engineered wood floorboards with our underfloor heating systems due to their strong structural design. As a broad rule of thumb all the engineered wood flooring options on the Wood and Beyond website could be fitted over under floor heating. While there are no rules for the thickness of the wood you can use with underfloor heating we recommend that wood thickness should be no more than 18mm as any thicker than this will hinder the efficient performance of the heating system. Also as wider timber boards will often show more movement than more narrow boards we recommend that the ratio of thickness to width should be in the region of 7 to 11.</p>

<p>Wood flooring manufactured and expected to perform at MC levels higher than 9 percent or in conditions above 50 percent RH should not be used with radiant heating systems. It is an attractive practical flooring solution that works well with underfloor heating. Its also recommended that you start with a cold temperature and slowly increase the temperature by around 4-5 degrees every day. The thickness of the boards is a consideration when choosing your product 18mm is the maximum recommended thickness for optimal efficiency whilst wider boards should be less than. Most wood flooring can be installed over radiant heat providing all of the necessary conditions are met.</p>

<p>Solid wood floors can warp and swell with changes in moisture and temperature however engineered floors are designed to withstand temperature changes and can be laid over many types of underfloor heating systems. It is typically recommended that a maximum floor surface temperature of 27C should not be. The efficiency of heating depends on the type of wood hardness resistance stability the thickness of the solid wood layer 10 - 20mm insulation type of heating system and the type of heating main or additional heating. A board with a thickness of 16mm and width of 160mm would give a ratio of 10 so is ideal. Engineered board made up of layers laminated together is a more stable product than solid timber.</p>

<p>However our preferred guidelines are to choose a solution that is between 14mm and 16mm. Here are our top picks. A Wood Idea recommends using flooring which is 14mm thick or less to maximise the heat transfer. As wood is a good insulator against heat engineered hardwood floors thickness and density can decrease the effectivity of underfloor heating. Also as wider timber boards will often show more movement than more narrow boards we recommend that the ratio of thickness to width should be in the region of 7 to 11.</p>

<p>It would be best to consult and get recommendations from the manufacturer of the flooring which among their products can be. Thick wooden floors will reduce the amount of heat passing from the heated slab underneath to the room above. The recommended board width of the engineered wood when going over underfloor heating is 150mm. A suspended wood floor lends itself to water pipe underfloor heating whereas a concrete base floor is suited to an electric heat mat. Wooden flooring is an excellent material to install on top of any underfloor heating system due to its warm feel and excellent thermal properties.</p>

<p>Engineered wooden floors while made of real wood are not solid wood cut boards from a single piece of natural timber. Also as wider timber boards will often show more movement than more narrow boards we recommend that the ratio of thickness to width should be in the region of 7 to 11. Solid wood floors can warp and swell with changes in moisture and temperature however engineered floors are designed to withstand temperature changes and can be laid over many types of underfloor heating systems. Just like engineered wood flooring the maximum underfloor heating temperature for laminate flooring is 27 degrees Celsius. As a guideline the maximum energy output from the floor will be in the region of 100Wm² based on a maximum surface temperature of 27C.</p>
