At Marions Carpet Warehouse in Wilsonville and Portland OR we carry a wide range of hardwood floors as well as many other high-quality options. I want to replace the carpet on the bottom level 3 flights of stairs and master bedroom suite. The closest wood flooring to pecan appears to be hickory. Then remove any nails and staples in the subflooring.</p>

How Can I Replace A Damaged Laminate Flooring Plank Flooring Laminate Floor Repair Laminate Hardwood Flooring</p>
<p>For a wood installation the subfloor would ideally be plywood of 34 or thicker or OSB. I have carpet on the lower ground floor level family room and top level bedrooms. Its possible to fix a problematic wood floor plank without replacing the entire floor. However some types of damage cant be repaired including. Instead replace the problem board and the leave the rest intact.</p>
