Wood flooring is kiln dried between 6- 9 moisture content which is the optimum moisture level for a home with normal living conditions. For engineered strips and planks the recommended spacing is between four and eight inches. A good rule of thumb for nail length is 1 12-inch nails for 12-inch-thick flooring and 1 34-inch nails for 34-inch-thick flooring. The nail guns used today for installing hardwood flooring are made to seat the nail just above the tongue and countersink it at approximately a 45-degree angle so the next board engages fully.</p>

How To Pull Up An Old Hardwood Floor Wooden Plank Flooring Reclaimed Hardwood Wood Plank Flooring</p>
<p>This is an old myth from back before wood flooring was properly kiln dried. Thats why we mention the need for more fasteners if the material is shorter than standard strip flooring. Always follow the flooring manufacturers recommendation. Staples are generally a cheaper choice of fastener but 16- 18- or 20-gauge flooring nails or cleats are the choice of pros. There are all different answers from 5 days to 2 weeks or more.</p>
