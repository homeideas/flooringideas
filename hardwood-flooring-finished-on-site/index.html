<p>Im not going to tell you how often I do. Contact us online or call 317 759-2575 to talk to our team of experts. Pros of finished on-site hardwoods.

The beveled edges of a prefinished floor also create a trap for additional dirt dust and grime which can be more difficult to clean than a floor that has been finished on site and is totally flat.</p>
