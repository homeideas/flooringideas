Because of the scratches from the well maintained dogs claws our realtor strongly suggested new floor covering. Any type of flooring you choose will eventually show damage over time hardwood floors. It sounds like your pets skid across the floor in similar locations time and time again. However there are ways to make sure that your dog can have fun and that your floors remain clean.</p>

I Don T Know Mr Boo But I D Like To Chevron Rugs Grey Wood Floors Grey Wood</p>
<p>Hardwood floors and dogs seem like two things that dont mix that well. Layout as many runners as you like but. Add Area Rugs to Your Floors. Hardwood floors are a durable and beautiful design element and dogs have a well-earned reputation as mans best friend. One of the biggest issues that I encounter is dogs and hardwood flooring more specifically large dogs who run in the house.</p>
