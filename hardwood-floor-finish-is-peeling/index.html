<p><strong>Hardwood Floor Finish Is Peeling</strong>, We had our hardwood floors refinished over the summer and they are starting to flake. Im guessing you should sand the small area down to where the damage is gone while also providing mechanical bond for you to reapply finish. In the dining rooms and entry way there are rugs on the hardwood floors with no pads and apparently water must have been spilled in a couple of areas and has seeped through to the floor because the polyurethane is peeling off in long strips.</p>
