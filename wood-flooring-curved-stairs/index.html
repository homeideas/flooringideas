You can see how in these Birch hardwood stair treads the direct of the boards run perpendicular to the flooring but the stairs present an interesting geometric design that sets the stage for the transition. Treads are instead a structural part of a bespoke staircase and need to be manufactured with high quality solid wood.</p>

Curved Staircase To Lower Level Open Concept Light Wood Floors Basement Design Traditional Staircase Staircase Design</p>
<p>For round steps using hardwood Oak boards would have to be joined using dowels or biscuits and glued wider and longer than what needed then layout the stair radius on the board and cut the tread as one piece usually using a band saw or a template and a router and after a curved nosing is made for after that its installed as one piece. Extremely happy with the Hardwood Flooring Outlet and the service they provide. The bottom plate of my curved wall is actually a series of wedge shaped pieces of 24 that. Stair treads are usually a solid piece of wood with a curved nose. I attached two wood pieces on each side to keep that riser in place.</p>
