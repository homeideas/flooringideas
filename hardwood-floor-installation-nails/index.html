How To Pull Up An Old Hardwood Floor Wooden Plank Flooring Reclaimed Hardwood Wood Plank Flooring</p>
<p>Beside above what nails should I use for subfloor. Each has its advantages but the success of either method will depend on the size and length of the nails or staples that are used. You need special nails called cleats for flooring. On a plywood subfloor you may float glue or nail down your new wood floor. Most 34-inch solid hardwood flooring can be installed using nails or staples over a wood subfloor.</p>

<p>This project focuses on installing an engineered floor with nails. Screws are similar so the wood could still squeak against the shaft of the screw or more likely against the next piece of wood. The National Wood Flooring Association guidelines recommend that nails or staples should be spaced between eight and ten inches for solid hardwood strips and planks. If youre installing over concrete youll need to drill pilot holes through the wood and into the concrete to set the nails. Insuring you have a suitable subfloor is the most important ingredient for any successful installation when laying solid 34 hardwoods.</p>
