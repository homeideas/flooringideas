When installing additional rows work from left to right. I cleaned up the glue along the way with mineral spirits and got all of the glue up before it dried. Apply a small amount of liquid cleaner directly to the surface of the hardwood and clean with a sponge mop or a clean cloth.</p>

<p>When installing additional rows work from left to right. Apply a small amount of liquid cleaner directly to the surface of the hardwood and clean with a sponge mop or a clean cloth.

<p>Glue Float and Nail installation are three main methods used for installing this type of floor. Part of the floor will be over a basement and part over a crawl spaceIt seems to me that the flooring should be glued directly to the sub-floor rather than. Because of its construction engineered hardwood brings with it a number of advantages including quick installation. Must be used when installing cork or parquet. Gluing down means no squeaky noise when you walk on it no squashy feel and just pure solid hardwood feel.</p>
