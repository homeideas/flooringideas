<p>We offer a broad collection of vinyl flooring engineered hardwood flooring solid hardwood flooring and laminate flooring. When you use multi-ply engineered flooring there are more layers of plywood which makes the floor stronger. Each layer of the plywood core has a glue line or bond line meaning that the flooring tends to be a little more susceptible to expansion and contraction than your typical wood flooring. Plywood core engineered flooring is typically less durable than solid core engineered flooring. Keep the beautiful wood look of a deck without the endless maintenance with Tuf board composite decking.</p>

<p>Engineered hardwood is ideal for laying on concrete subfloor as its designed to help prevent the floor from shifting with changes in temperature and moisture. The high density fiberboard core is made from recycled hardwood which is manufactured by grinding damaged or defective hardwood into a sawdust and mixing it with a resin then compressing it together to form HDF core.
