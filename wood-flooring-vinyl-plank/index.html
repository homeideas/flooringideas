Interlocking vinyl plank flooring creates a floating floor but instead of having an adhesive connecting the planks the planks interlock with tongue-and-groove joints that easily snap together for a reliable fit. We service the whole of the Western Cape with our vinyl flooring. Super-durable hardwood species can be more resistant to denting than vinyl plank. The type of vinyl flooring that mimics wood most effectively is luxury vinyl plank or LVP.</p>

<p>Our company is one of the premier wood vinyl flooring companies covering the Western Cape. Luxury vinyl tile will be styled to look like textured stone or clean ceramic tile stylings. The wood effect planks are stain and water resistant making them suitable for splash areas such as Kitchens and the peel and stick fitting style means there is virtually no mess or dust created when laying these vinyl floor planks. Vinyl floors are a popular option among homeowners particularly in kitchen and bathroom applications. Keep in mind that some of the best hardwood floor brands also make laminate and vinyl plank so.</p>

<p>View in my room. Although market demand influences prices many exotic wood-look styles cost the same as other plank designs because LVP can be printed to look like virtually any wood. Vinyl also comes in a variety of styles. Firstly vinyl is cheaper than real wood as an upfront cost as well as for maintenance. View in my room.</p>
