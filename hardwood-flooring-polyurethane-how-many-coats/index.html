<p>Polyurethane is a common finish that people use to protect their hardwood floors. Of course this will depend on the type of polyurethane you are using. When applying water-based polyurethane on hardwood floors youll need to apply a minimum of three coats. Once the stain coat is completely dried the users then need to apply the layer of the polyurethane to the entire surface of the hardwood floor by using the paintbrush and then let the hardwood floor to dry for near about two hours before applying the second layer of the polyurethane. Floor refinishing requires a heavy sanding to remove all finishes and to take off enough wood to remove scratches and discolorations.</p>

<p>When applying water-based polyurethane on hardwood floors youll need to apply a minimum of three coats. Choosing to apply between 2-3 layers of polyurethane formula on your surface depends entirely on the use of your structure. Depending on the type of wood and condition of the stairs usually two or three coats of oil-based polyurethane are enough. Also it can add an amber glow to the wood making it susceptible to brush marks. For surfaces that will see occasional and hard wear such as the floor should have a minimum of three layers.</p>
