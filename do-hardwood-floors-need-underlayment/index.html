As you can see installing an underlayment is a smart decision when planning to install a hardwood floor. Wood-against-wood friction is one of the most common reasons behind floor creaks. Hardwood flooring comes in many different hardwoods such as maple hickory ash oak and many other exotic varieties.</p>

<p>The underlayment will reduce the sound of footsteps creaking and other noises. Plywood has some moisture resistance already compared to solid wood and it mostly gives a smooth surface. If you already have a plywood subfloor and the subfloor is smooth and level then you may not need an underlayment beneath the hardwood floor. The vapor barrier will keep the moisture from reaching your hardwood floorboards. It works as a vapor barrier and shields the wood boards against water.</p>

<p>Known for their easy to clean high quality look long-term investment and ageless quality. My advice - contact the MANUFACTURERS of the flooring BEFORE DECIDING. 99 of the time the answer is no. The vapor barrier will keep the moisture from reaching your hardwood floorboards. Hardwood floors do not require underlayment padding but they may squeak and creak if you place the surface boards directly against the underlayment.</p>
