Engineered wood flooring is quite simply hardwood flooring where the boards consist of more than one layer. Whether you choose the increasingly popular wide plank wood flooring a mixed width hardwood flooring or the classic narrow plank option let Classic Wood Floors help guide you. Narrow planks of flooring are usually classed as anything smaller than 125mm in width. With a keen eye for craftsmanship we pride ourselves on sourcing materials of the highest calibre and hold a great passion for the innovation and development of our products.</p>

<p>It looks and feels just like a traditional wooden floor because the top layer is real solid hardwood and it is perfect for use as paneling or even joinery projects like doors and tabletops as well as for floors. Narrow planks of flooring are usually classed as anything smaller than 125mm in width. The thicker base layer is usually plywood. At Wood Floor Warehouse we buy all our engineered wood floors in bulk and direct from the factory to ensure the best possible prices. Beneath this veneer are multiple layers of wood or plywood that help to form.</p>
