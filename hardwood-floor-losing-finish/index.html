<p>If your floor is natural unstained wood. Its ready for a full sand and refinish. You just might be able to save yourself a lot of. Also keep in mind a lot of wood floors are stained with color and if the protective finish is worn down or missing you might just be rubbing some of that stain color onto your cloth. Then use an electric drum sander to sand the floors.</p>

<p>Most people want to move into their home as soon as the finish is dry on their wood floors. There are many homeowners who have discovered the ease and efficiency of homemade hardwood floor cleaners such as vinegar olive oil lavender baking soda and lemon in cleaning hardwood floors. Hardwood floors are usually finished with polyurethane which is a surface finish meaning that this type of flooring should never be waxed. Then use a paper towel to rub it into the floor paying special attention to working it into the scratched areas. Be absolutely sure to get the same urethane product and finish satin semi gloss or gloss to do the overcoat.</p>
