<p>There will be some seasonal humidity changes but I dont think itll be enough to cause problems on the stairs. If you are installing engineered hardwood on your existing stairs you are already eliminating a significant portion of the cost of the project.

That includes below-grade rooms like basements and humid areas like attics although you need to make sure the product is rated for those areas beforehand. Hardwood is very easy to clean and requires very little maintenance making it a particularly good choice for stair treads risers and balustrades.</p>
