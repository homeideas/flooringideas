<p>In Europe we do. Install the hardwood flooring so that it is just under the edge of the cabinet positions. We do not install hardwood in kitchen under cabinets on the plumbinggas wall. It would be a shame for you or the future owner to want to change the kitchen footprint and need to replace all of the flooring in the areas where you did not install it. Ask a flooring expert if the hardwood flooring you select can be installed over the existing tile.</p>
