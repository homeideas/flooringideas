<p>Were replacing our carpeting in the family room and entry hall with wood laminate flooring. They put hundreds of staples into my original hardwood floors when they attached the under padding. If you are attempting to search for concepts for 11 great hardwood flooring home depot vs lowes this is the place to be. Check out the American Home 516 in. Both lowes and home depot use an independent installation company to handle all their flooring installations and they in turn hire subcontractors to do the work.</p>

<p>Ive had both Home Depot and Lowes come out to measure so I could get an estimate. Most of these stores sell them for 8-10 mostly 10 per sqft. Home Depot stopped carrying unfinished solid wood flooring and I think Lowes did too. 138250 at Home DepotOn our more general shopping list 11 products were cheaper at Lowes with average savings of just over 13. I have beautiful hardwood floors in my 1937 home but we have limited mobility challenges so we decided to have carpeting installed.</p>
