<p>Proper underlayment for solid hardwood flooring. The right underlayment will help conceal the imperfections leaving your flooring unaffected. Laminate flooring with pre-attached underlayment padding tends to be thinner. Hardwood manufacturer sells their own underlayment and its about 2 mm thick 3mil vapor barrier. Unlike wooden floors that tend to dent with impacts the installation of laminate flooring with an attached underlayment creates a stronger surface for impacts.</p>

<p>This is because of a lack of moisture barrier. Proper underlayment for solid hardwood flooring. Underlayment is a requirement for laminate flooring. While you can use underlays suitable for concrete on a timber floor you can never use an underlay made for timber sub-floors on a concrete floor. As a result the bumps and depressions can make your floor uncomfortable to walk on and may ruin the beauty of the floor.</p>
