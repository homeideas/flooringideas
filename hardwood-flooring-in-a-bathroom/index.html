<p>Solid Hardwood Flooring is Not a Good Choice for Bathrooms. The reason why it stands at the top is because of how you finish the project when the wood is laid. Take extra caution around areas where splashes or spills are a part of your normal routine. Laying tile is much more time consuming and not to mention more expensive if.

You can have bare wood around liquid water thats seen a lot in older things where either they were never finished or whatever was there is long gone like decades gone or longer. The floor boards will eventually start twisting buckling warping and plumping.</p>
