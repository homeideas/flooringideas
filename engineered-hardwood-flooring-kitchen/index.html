Pin On Hardwood</p>
<p>Traditionally hardwood flooring has proved unsuitable for areas with high levels of moisture and humidity being susceptible to warping and shrinkages. Engineered Wood Kitchen Flooring Many people worry about using wood for their kitchen flooring and in some respects theyre right to do so. This type of flooring contains a surface layer of genuine hardwood with many layers of composite wood beneath. Our kitchen engineered wood floors are hard wearing and can even manage spills provided they are cleaned up. If this is a nail down floor run it under the cabs if its a floating floor install plywood that is 18 or 14 thicker than your flooring under the area where the cabs will go then install cabs first then the flooring the gap will be covered later by the toe-kick.</p>
