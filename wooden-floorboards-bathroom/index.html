You could also try timber laminate floorboards. Find a place you can lift the carpet slightly and then run the knife down it to create a strip. This means that in 910 cases bathrooms have subfloors constructed from floorboards or chipboard screwed or nailed onto joists. Do we have to have a subfloor that is waterproof and then lay the floorboards on top.</p>

<p>Prepare your floorboards for painting. Firstly tiles particularly porcelain ones are more durable than floorboards in that they dont scratch and mark as easily. Unless properly treated and sealed by professionals or prefinished specifically for a bathroom floor a wooden floor can develop moisture problems especially under the toilet. The key is in the installation. When you apply the varnish brush it well into the floorboard gaps and then finish off in the grain direction as usual.</p>
