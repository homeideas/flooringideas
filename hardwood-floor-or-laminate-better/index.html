<p>Both vinyl and laminate are designed as alternatives to natural materials like hardwood flooring. Laminate has a wider selection of finishes mimicking natural floors such as hardwood or having bright patterns and colorful designs. Laminate flooring is often thought of as a cheaper option than engineered wood flooring. Walk into any old home even those built back in the late 1800s and you may find some well-loved hardwood underneath years of vinyl tile. Hardwood tends to be more expensive and difficult to install but also offers greater resale value and the ability to refinish the surface over time.</p>
