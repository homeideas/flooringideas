Flooring Laminate Vs Hardwood Vs Engineered Hardwood Engineered Hardwood Flooring Hardwood Floors Flooring</p>
<p>Both engineered hardwood and laminate flooring are fairly easy to install but laminate flooring tends to be slightly easier for DIYers. You can obtain beautiful exotic wood species at a much lower price when compared to solid hardwood because engineered wood only uses a thin veneer layer. Not only is it cheaper per square metre laminate also offers the advantage of potential DIY installation meaning even bigger savings when compared to engineered hardwood. Laminate on the other hand has a photographic textured top layer. Engineered hardwood floors are more stable than laminate floors or solid hardwood and can be used in areas with a high moisture content where laminate and solid wood cannot.</p>
