<p>The pricing of real wood flooring varies considerably - the species of timber the grade of timber the size of the planks and in the case of engineered floors the thickness of the top layer all affect the price. Engineered wood flooring is cheaper than solid wood and looks better than laminate - 20 up to 100 per sq. Most variances of engineered wood will cost on average between 30 square metres to 90 square metres. Engineered wood is usually slightly less expensive and costs from 20 50 per square meter. Traditional flooring is solid wood without any layers in comparison to engineered wood which is constructed with multiple layers of hardwood and plywood.</p>
