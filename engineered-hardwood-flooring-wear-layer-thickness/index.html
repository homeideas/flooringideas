<p>Most people do not think an engineered floor can be refinished as many times as a solid hardwood floor. A high quality engineered wood will be able to be sanded and refinished as many times as a solid wood floor depending on the thickness of the wear layer. The wear layer being the top layer if it is 3mm thick you should really only expect to sand it once or maybe twice but if it is 6mm thick youll probably get away with 5 or so professional sandings in its lifetime. The thickness of wear layers varies from paper thin 06 mm to super thick 6 mm. Most people do not think an engineered floor can be refinished as many times as a solid hardwood floor.</p>

<p>Do I need engineered wood. The wear layer can vary in thickness from as thin as 2mm up to 6mm. Thin wear layers MAY be able to be resanded but the chances of sanding through the veneer are greater. The thickness of the wear layer on engineered hardwood flooring varies from product to product. This also means that engineered hardwood flooring options with a thicker wear layer are often more expensive but they will last much longer than thinner options.</p>

<p>For engineered floors there are two components that make up the thickness. Our thick 58mm wear layer product equals the longevity of traditional solid 34 inch hardwood floors.
