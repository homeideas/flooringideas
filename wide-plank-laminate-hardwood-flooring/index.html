<p>These products have a Spill Shield to product each plank from water damage for up to 72 hours. While luckily this stuff is my cup of teait can still be totally overwhelming. Because it is thinner than laminate and far thinner than a real wood plank luxury vinyl flooring may have the width of the plank but not. Best of all laminate flooring is a do it yourself installation saving you money on installation charges. If you drop a dish on a laminate tile floor its less likely to chip.</p>

<p>Pergo is not only the first to manufacture laminate flooring but they are also the best. I had a really hard time deciding on flooring for our main level. Wide plank flooring also means fewer seams between boards and thus fewer interruptions of the natural lines of both the wood and the room. They capture the essence of trunk wood flooring well and show off the most natural features of a bespoke wood floor. We select all of our wide plank wood floors directly from the best timber mills to ensure the very highest quality.</p>
