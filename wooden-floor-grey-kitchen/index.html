Brighten up your dark gray cabinets with some light hardwood flooring. Beneath the top coat glued to the sturdy core is a thin veneer of real wood which makes engineered wood flooring almost like the real deal except its much more durable.</p>

<p>Floor to ceiling grey cabinetry makes the most of kitchen space while a real life tree takes centre stage right through the middle of it. Such is the case with Jenni Lis Kitchen recently featured on One Kings Lane. The pendants are from a Czechoslovakian factory and the 1940s stools are by Warren McArthur. A pretty blue kitchen with a grey floral wallpaper wall and touches of gold and stained wood is vintage chic. Just be sure the tones of timber flooring and timber used in the kitchen dont clash.</p>

Grey gloss kitchens lend well to ultra-modern interiors where handle-free designs create a seamless streamline look. Well yes a greyed purple is technically warmer than a green or blue grey but its still cool in comparison to raspberry kelly green and turquoise etc. The grey tones in this kitchen go well with the white walls and dark granite countertops.
