<p>If you wish to have natural wood in a bathroom engineered wood is the best choice. Engineered floors are the way to go for surfaces that are ideal for washroom purposes. Engineered hardwood flooring is not as durable as the original hardwood flooring but it is gaining popularity these days because of its low maintenance and cost. Since the bathroom is the most humid room in the house youll want to go with a floor that is known for its water resistance and dimensional stability.
