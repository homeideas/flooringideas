Repair Water Damage On Hardwood Floors Hardwood Floors Prefinished Hardwood Flooring</p>
<p>The DriTac Engineered Wood Floor Repair Kit is designed to correct and eliminate hollow spots and popping conditions for engineered wood floor installations. This approach is suitable for both real-wood and engineered real wood flooring repairs using a repair putty or wax filler mixed to match the color of surrounding floor. Thank you for watching my first ever YouTube video. Due to the fact that engineered floors are not completely solid hardwood they cannot be sanded and refinished indefinitely so your options are a little more limited than with solid hardwood. DriTac Wood Floor Repair Kit-Engineered Flooring did what it was suppose to do.</p>

<p>Repair to this flooring will depend on the type and extent of the damage. It is very easy and fast when you know how and the scratch is not a deep gouge. Thank you for watching my first ever YouTube video. Unlike solid hardwood flooring engineered hardwood has a veneer of hardwood over a backing of another material. DriTac Wood Floor Repair Kit-Engineered Flooring ONLY 32oz.</p>
