<p>There are many different types of glue and every flooring manufacturer has their own glue that they recommend using for the flooring.

<p>The glue-down method is commonly used in slab construction because it allows the flooring to be attached directly to a concrete slab. In very dry or humid regions gluing the floor down will limit expansion and contraction of the floor. Engineered hardwood products may be fastened stapled or glued on above or below grade. Is glue down or nail down better for engineered wood flooring. The glue is your moisture barrier so theres no need for underlayment.</p>
