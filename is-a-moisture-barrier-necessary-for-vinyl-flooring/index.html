<p>If youre installing vinyl flooring on top of a wood subfloor theres no need to use a moisture barrier. Floating Floor Installations When installing laminate or other floating floors over cement VCT ceramic tiles or kitchen vinyl use 6 mil poly sheeting plastic as the moisture barrier. With a vapor barrier in the floor everything below it can get damp from crawlspace moisture but things above are protected. A moisture or vapor barrier prevents water from wicking up from the ground through the sub-floor and absorbing into the hardwood floor. Its best to talk with one of our flooring consultants who can help you make a decision based on the manufacturer you select.</p>
