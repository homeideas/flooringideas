Laminate flooring consists of a water-resistant base layer that stabilizes the plank. Laminate does a great job of copying the look of genuine hardwood but it cant hold a candle to hardwoods longevity because it cant be refinished.</p>

<p>Laminate is predominantly human-made while hardwood floors are made of actual wood. Well many people do but in certain situations its worth taking a moment to compare laminate flooring advantages with other flooring types. The core layer provides structure and stability and is often made of fiberglass. It not only looks closer to real hardwood grains it is also made of 99 wood material so it is sturdier and it is less prone to being damaged easily. Compared to laminate flooring vinyl offers a little more variety in design too.</p>
