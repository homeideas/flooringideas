<p>Long-length hardwood flooring reaches the official long length status once it hits up to nine feet in length. Long is our standard length class which features much longer average plank lengths than other manufacturers generally 3 to 8 feet long but at the most budget friendly price. When deciding upon a hardwood floor one of the choices you will have is whether to choose random length or fixed length planks of flooring. Some products can be 1 thick with up to 12 feet long or even longer. If the room is wider than it is long laying the flooring on the vertical will help create the illusion of length in the room and balance it out.</p>

<p>To achieve this pattern hardwood flooring planks are installed parallel to each other along with the length or width of your room. Long is our standard length class which features. The authentic and charming character of the wood is underpinned by the lengths of 4000 or 5000 mm. For those unable to decide or who are looking for a more random look Shaw offers styles with even combinations of 3-inch widths 5-inch widths and 7-inch widths. We had our dining room and hall floors replaced while we were away and I notice that the average plank length is only about 3-4 ft.</p>
