<p>All polyurethane finishes are water-resistant but flooring professionals advise using water sparingly &ndash; if at all &ndash; for cleaning. In business since 1898 DuraSeal specializes in products specifically for hardwood floors and is generally sold to professional flooring contractors. Therefore products which claim to be safe for hard surfaces or even wood floors are not necessarily safe. If the spill has already dried onto the floor spray it with some glass cleaner before. DuraSeal Hardwood Floor Cleaner is intended for use on all wood floors coated with a clear unwaxed finish including polyurethane and waterbased finishes.</p>
