<p>Solid hardwood engineered hardwood and luxury vinyl planks all have their individual uniqueness. Not quite as low as the cost to install vinyl plank flooring but definitely cheaper than the cost to finish your hardwood on-site. Luxurious vinyl planks on the other hand are waterproof. Also if you are looking for a more contemporary vibe or a more polished look the knots and loud wood grain can work against that. WPC flooring contains wood plastic composite while SPC contains stone plastic composite.</p>

Fresh Oak House Flooring Lifeproof Vinyl Flooring Flooring</p>
<p>Both solid hardwood and engineered hardwood are not waterproof and this is why they are not recommended for areas with high humidity and moisture. Solid plank hardwood is authentic wood which tends to be great quality and will last for years if taken care of. Prefinished solid wood floors initially cost more than unfinished wood flooringabout 2 per square foot for a good grade of red oak. LVP flooring is crafted with four layers including a waterproof PVC vinyl core and a scratch- and stain-resistant top layer perfect for pets and kids. You might think that hardwood flooring is very durable and hard hints the name but almost the opposite is true.</p>
