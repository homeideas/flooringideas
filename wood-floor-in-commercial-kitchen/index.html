<p>Hardwood floors look beautiful warm and inviting. Does not require a plywood subfloor This means that if you have concrete you can install the hardwood directly over it. Ceramic is tried and true as kitchen flooring. Hardwood flooring is revered as luxurious because of the many benefits it brings to a space. For 2021 tiles continue to be popular as kitchen flooring.</p>

<p>Wood floors in the kitchen maintain consistency in a home with an open floor plan where the hardwood flooring is used in adjoining areas. Hardwood Floors Dont Stand Up Well to Traffic. Dishware may well survive falls onto hardwood flooring but at the same time a dropped can of vegetables could dent the wood. It is lovely to look at timeless in design and easy to refinish whenever styles change. In 2021 and I believe for at least the next decade you will see a surge in low-maintenance flooring like waterproof vinyl.</p>
