<p>If durability ranks high on your list of needs try an oil based penetrating. More importantly the finish is able to highlight the color natural beauty and grain of the wood. Also a few thick regular floor cloths and rubber gloves unless you want your hands to get that Nordic look too. All it takes to maintain its shine is a little light mopping. Its not so bad that the Swedish finish smell is burning ours eyes or throat.</p>

Swedish Finish Wood Floors Wikizie Co Red Oak Hardwood Floors Red Oak Hardwood Red Oak Floors</p>
<p>Unlike most finishes which form a layer on top of the hardwood a Swedish finish actually chemically bonds with the wooda conversion process that results in an especially hard finish. More importantly the finish is able to highlight the color natural beauty and grain of the wood. Also a few thick regular floor cloths and rubber gloves unless you want your hands to get that Nordic look too. Special care must be taken the first month since Swedish Finish needs time to create the excellent hardness durability and spot resistance to soaps detergents water pets fruit juices ink alcohol etc. Swedish finish is simply a nice-sounding name for a conversion varnish which cures by chemical reaction.</p>
