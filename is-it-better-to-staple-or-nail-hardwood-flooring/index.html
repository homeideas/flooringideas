<h3 id="cleats-are-around-the-same-price-as-flooring-staples-but-have-less-availability">Cleats are around the same price as flooring staples but have less availability.</h3><p>One other pro of nailing down hardwood floors is that if one floorboard gets damaged it can be easily replaced without affecting the beauty of your floors.

The problem with pneumatic nailers is you CANNOT get as tight a floor as with a manual nailer.</p>

Insuring you have a suitable subfloor is the most important ingredient for any successful installation when laying solid 34 hardwoods. Bear in mind too that I was in the hardwood business BEFORE any of the new tools were brought in to the picture. Cleats are the way to go.</p>

<p>As for staples or cleats L nails. They cost approximately 4000 per 5000 nails. Failure to heed this vital prerequisite will lead to spongy creaking and popping sounds. Floors that are of hardwood and have a thickness of 075 inches are suitable for staples. So T moldings are not required.</p>

<p>Going for the Staples. Most experts agree that cleats allow for greater movement in areas with high humidity meaning your hardwood flooring will look better longer. With a glued down or nailed down hardwood floor each plank is fastened directly to the subfloor and not to the adjacent plank so when one plank expands it does not necessarily affect the others planks. Most of the better quality hardwood floor nails are resin coated. Because each staple grips the wood with two prongs staples provide a tighter initial grip than cleat nails.</p>
