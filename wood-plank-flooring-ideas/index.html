<p>On Pinterest there was a gazillion well maybe not quite that many plywood flooring ideas but the one that was the best fit for us was the wide plank flooring. Theres no getting around it hickory is a beautiful choice. Buy your wood from a local lumber store. Hardwood floors are pet-friendly dogs hate them. To bring high style to your space choose eucalyptus hardwood flooring.</p>
