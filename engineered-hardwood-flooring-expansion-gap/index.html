Wood Flooring Behavior In The Winter Problems With Gaps Laminate Flooring Floor Installation Flooring</p>
<p>In general leaving a space of 10-15mm is adequate however always ask one of our flooring experts as gaps may vary. However engineered wood flooring like other types of flooring also needs an expansion gap. An expansion gap is one of the most reliable ways to avoid serious issues with your engineered wood flooring. Surely the flooring doesnt expand by that much. This will allow engineered planks to naturally expand and contract without causing disfigurement to the overall floor.</p>
