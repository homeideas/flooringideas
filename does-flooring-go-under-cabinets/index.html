<p>Floating laminate hardwood and vinyl planks should go in after the cabinets. Base units are better positioned on a solid floor. Go ahead and install your kitchen cabinets directly on the cement subfloor. This could cause the floor to come apart. There are however other types of flooring such as linoleum hardwood and tile that you might install in a kitchen.</p>

<p>When you place your laminate flooring strips underneath your cabinetry you make the process more burdensome. If the cabinets are going in before the floor then have the cabinets mounted on top of 34 or 12 plywood depending on the thickness of the floor. Another drawback with this procedure is doing repairs when the flooring runs under the cabinetry. How level the sub floor is shouldnt be an issue as each unit will have legs that are individually adjustable so a run of units can be adjusted to a uniform level. Are these floorings okay to have under kitchen cabinets.</p>
