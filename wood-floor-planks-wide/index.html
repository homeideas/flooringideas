<p>We select all of our wide plank wood floors directly from the best timber mills to ensure the very highest quality. Though wide plank flooring has a rich history in architecture it is a stylish addition to a modern space. Along with velvet satin silk and beeswax candles wide floorboards were a hallmark of wealth and power. Instead of the standard ¾ inch plank which makes up most hardwood flooring a wide plank can be a plank ranging anywhere from 5 inches to 20 inches wide. We have updated our ever-popular Mountain View Hickory product line to the wider longer format that is dominating the hardwood flooring market.</p>

<p>We believe the use of wider and longer length planks reduces the number of end and edge seams creating a more authentic looking floor. The generous length and width of these planks alone create an elegant yet impressive floor but when combined with a one of our beautiful finishes they open up a whole world of fabulous design options. This is true for both wide plank engineered wood flooring and wide plank solid wood flooring. Best described as perfectly rustic Mountain View features artisan hand scraping and hand staining.
