<p>Few flooring surfaces can match the look and feel of real hardwood. Larger tile sizes remain popular as they have in previous years. You can change the look of the room by adding a new area rug or two to give it a whole new feel. Especially if you had bad 80s carpet beforehand. Wood floors in the kitchen maintain consistency in a home with an open floor plan where the hardwood flooring is used in adjoining areas.</p>
