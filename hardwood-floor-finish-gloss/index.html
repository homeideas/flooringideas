<p>When your flooring arrives at your home you will see the beauty and advantage of. In all honesty most hardwoods whether glossy or not are equally durable. If the hardwood is a darker wood like mahogany cherry or oak the grain will be enhanced and stand out magnificently. Prior to the final coat of finish you can inspect the floor it will be a snick shinier than real life. 50 gloss a high sheen.</p>

Glossy Semigloss Satin What S The Difference Between Hardwood Finishes Anyway Cherry Hardwood Flooring Wood Floors Wood Floor Finishes</p>
<p>The Satin Floor Finish image from our gallery of floor sanding projects may help with your decision making. It used to be one of the more popular floor finishing choices but its not used nearly as often in modern designs. Gloss finishes are suitable for areas with less foot traffic like a study or small indoor porch. The glossier a floor finish the more light is reflected. However if you go too far down the low gloss road to natural or ultra-matte finishes they actually start to show markings and dirt a bit easier.</p>
