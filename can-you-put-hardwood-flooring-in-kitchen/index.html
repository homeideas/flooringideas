While hardwood floors in living areas may be finished with various traditional penetrating oils kitchen floors typically need a surface finish such as polyurethane that completely seals the wood surface to prevent penetration from water and staining agents and creates a highly washable surface. As long as the surface is smooth and level technically you can install hardwood floor over your existing flooring.</p>

Hardwood Floors Need Little Maintenance And Can Be Refinished If Damaged They Can Go With Almost Any D Flooring Options Types Of Flooring Kitchen Improvements</p>
<p>This drawback also has a silver lining. Installing hardwood flooring in a kitchen is a great option because it lasts a long time. Competitively priced Wood flooring is more affordable than tile and polished concrete and competitive with LVT when the cost of materials and installation is considered. As long as the surface is smooth and level technically you can install hardwood floor over your existing flooring. If vinyl flooring is the pre-existing floor hardwood kitchen floors can be installed over the existing flooring without the need for removal because hardwood floors float above it.</p>

<p>Plank tile 8 wide by 48 long is a big hit as are 12 x 24 ceramic tiles. Hardwood is able to stand up to either stains or spills. Floating floors are clicked together and not adhered to the floor. Floating floors come in a variety of materials such as engineered hardwood or cork but not all are suitable for a kitchen floor installation. Wood floors in the kitchen maintain consistency in a home with an open floor plan where the hardwood flooring is used in adjoining areas.</p>
