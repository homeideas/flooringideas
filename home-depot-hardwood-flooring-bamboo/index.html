<p>The Advantages of Bamboo Flooring. Bamboo is a woody grass that looks and feels similar to wood. Ive seen common red oak stair treads unfinished and risers sold in Depot as well along with Pine. As with hardwood flooring the glossier the finish the more scratches will show. Although most people think of bamboo as wood that is not the full picture.</p>

<p>L Engineered Bamboo Flooring. Transforming any room with beautiful new bamboo flooring just got a lot easier. The average cost of bamboo is around 5 to 6 a square foot for material and around 10 a square foot installedHardwood costs start around 350 a square foot but can be as high as 1250 a square foot for material and 12 to 21 installed. Its also important to remember bamboo is actually a form of grass not a true hardwood although its considerably tougher than other types of building materials.
