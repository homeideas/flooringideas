<p>One of the disadvantages of engineered wood compared to laminate is that it tends to be a bit pricierbecause it is a real wood floor. Sadly there are disadvantages to every type of flooring. The other good point to laminate flooring is its longevity. Because the core of laminate flooring is wood it doesnt hold up well to moisture. Both options offer water resistance resistance to mold and mildew.</p>
