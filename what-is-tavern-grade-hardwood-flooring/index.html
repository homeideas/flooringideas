<p>Taverncabin grade hardwood floors. Rustic grade hardwood sometimes is called 2 tavern or cabin grade flooring. Wife like some maple in this grade and I am worried about the splitscracks durabilityquality. I realize its the low end of wood and has knots and what not just want to hear if people regret. Finding tavern grade hardwood can be a challenge as many retailers do not carry it.</p>
