<p>Hardwood floors and dogs can live in harmony with a few rules says Pitman. Most of the engineered hardwood species react with the dog urine so you should avoid these and use the hardwood instead of engineered wood. Its more advisable to install solid wood flooring. Floods are fairly rare but almost everybody has dog or a cat or a rabbit that will eventually leave a puddle on the hardwood floor. Engineered wood flooring a sandwich of laminated wood with a real hardwood veneer on top is an excellent product.</p>
