<p>Have you considered hardwood on the stairsupstairs hallway and carpet in the bedrooms. I saw model homes this weekend in irvine ca at the pavilion park part of the great park and many models had stairs and the upstairs hallway with carpet and wood floors in each of the individual rooms. Cost and noise reduction come immediately to mind. Whereas carpets are the best soundproof flooring material. The hardwood will scratch in high traffic areas especially if you kids wear shoes in the house rocks mud etc.</p>
