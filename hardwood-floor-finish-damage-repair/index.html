Finish restorers are designed to help treat faded finishes or light scratches distributed across a wide area of your hardwood floors. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being fully replaced. If you plan to salvage some of the plank perhaps only a portion of it is damaged for some other wood floor repair project make sure that you do this carefully.</p>
