<p>In order to nail your hardwood floor down it must be at least 18mm thick and you should run the planks of flooring perpendicular to any existing floor boards. Place a scrap piece of flooring between the one youre installing and the screwdriver then pound the screwdriver into the subfloor and use it as a lever to draw the boards together. We highly recommend a pneumatic nailer. Set the drive to set the nails lower than usual because you wont be in contact with the wood. Insuring you have a suitable subfloor is the most important ingredient for any successful installation when laying solid 34 hardwoods.</p>
