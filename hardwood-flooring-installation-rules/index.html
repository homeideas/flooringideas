<p>Choose the perfect trim for your HardwoodInstallation. For existing wood floors install new flooring at right angles to the existing flooring. Imported flooring supplied to a lower moisture content range will need additional attention likely through acclimatisation or additional expansion allowance in order for it to be suitable for laying. Rawl space should be a minimum of ð ñ ómm from ground to underside of joists. Any floor framing timber is to have moisture contents no greater than 14 at the time of floor installation.</p>
