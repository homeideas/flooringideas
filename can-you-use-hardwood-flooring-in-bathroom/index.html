Pin On House Remodel</p>
<p>The look of wooden flooring in your bathroom cant really be matched by any other material. It also helps that wood floors are warmer underfoot. And yes wood flooring in the bathroom is risky. Is wood flooring in the bathroom a good idea. Extra care should be taken during installment.</p>

<p>As the use of prefinished hardwood floors has emerged wood is able to better withstand use in a wet area such as the bathroom but many people still hold onto the belief that this would ruin the floor. I want to avoid any mould growth or other damage from moisture. If you are looking for a wood look in your bathroom the best choice is a vinyl floor which is water proof and slip resistant. Hardwood is a better bathroom flooring choice than say carpet but it can still be very problematic. Full baths with tubs and kids is not a good idea.</p>
