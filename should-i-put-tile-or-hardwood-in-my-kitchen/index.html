<p>Currently have carpet in living and dinning We have dogs and cats and I am really really wondering what is best to go with for flooring Something that is going to be durable for the long long term Should we go with Bamboom Ceramicetile or other. Flooring guys will tell you never to put hardwood in a kitchen. Hardwood Floors are easier on your feet. Hardwood floors in kitchen settings are warmer and easier on feet compared with stone and ceramic tile especially when youre standing during prep and cleanup. Choose the right tile materials.</p>

Kitchen Floors Tiles Vs Wood Wood Floor Design Flooring Wood Floors</p>
<p>Larger tile sizes remain popular as they have in previous years. Choose the right tile materials. Still others will tell you its okay. Its easy to keep clean which makes it a top choice for kitchens. Wood flooring is comfortable to stand on and can be beautiful.</p>
