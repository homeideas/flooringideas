We bought a foreclosure that was in need of some SERIOUS repairs so getting the nursery. I think a carpet is better a lot warmer and when the baby moves the cot it wont slip on the floor wooden floors are more likely to scratch and they are very dusty i know that from experience so unless u clean it nearly everyday its likely that the baby will breath in. Babies grow and children dont need carpeted floors forever. The last time we went house hunting I refused to even look at anything unless there were hardwood floors.</p>
