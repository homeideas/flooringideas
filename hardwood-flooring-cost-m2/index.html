<p>Prices range from 4680 to 7070 for a floor sander and edge sander Prices correct as of Jan 2020. The price includes the old flooring removed and prepared and the laminate flooring supplied and installed. Add to this the cost of a high-range tiler at 120 per square metre and youre looking at anything in excess of 320 per square metre. Oak wood flooring is more expensive and costs around 1100 to be installed and is the cheapest real wood flooring. Of course not all parquet floors.</p>
