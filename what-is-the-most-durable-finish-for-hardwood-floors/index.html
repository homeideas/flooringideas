<p>One of the nicest things about using an engineered hardwood floor is the fact that most come prefinished with a factory applied durable coating. Ceramic tiles are man-made from natural materials in this case clay and baked to a finish. Do you have any hardwood floor nightmare or success stories. While you can purchase floorboards without a finish these days there are so many options for pre-finished wood flooring especially at retail. Hardwood floors can be finished according to your specific needs and aesthetic preferences.</p>
