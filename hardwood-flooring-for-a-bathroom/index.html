Dark Gray Weathered Wooden Floors In Rustic Bathroom Wood Tile Bathroom Bathrooms Remodel Bathroom Redo</p>
<p>Solid hardwood flooring will absorb moisture whether it is from high humidity or water spilled onto it. This means you can have the sleek current bathroom of your dreams with good ol dependable tile flooring. Solid Hardwood Flooring is Not a Good Choice for Bathrooms. Nails and screws will puncture the barrier. No scrubbing in between tile joints which I despise.</p>
