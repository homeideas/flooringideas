<p>So using hardwood flooring in a bathroom will sooner or later force you to deal with mold and mildew. I know hardwood is not recommended for bathrooms but would it. Many homes have bathrooms with wood floors. I have a half bath off of my foyer that I was going to put hardwood in as well since it would flow very nicely. You can test if the finish layer is still intact by dropping a small amount of water on it and waiting to see if the water beads up or is absorbed into the wood.</p>

<p>While the protective layer of a sealant may be able to delay it for a bit it will eventually grow between as well as beneath the boards. It might be fine in a small guest lavatory but should not be used where a shower or bathtub will be in frequent use. But thats probably because we are empty nesters living in a dry climate where the floors are not exposed to continuous moisture. You can learn more about how we made it possible to have waterproof hardwoods here including how third-party testing found our floors can handle up.
