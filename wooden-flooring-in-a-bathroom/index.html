Engineered hardwood flooring is dimensionally stable and therefore does not fluctuate too much in response to humidity so its generally best to go with engineered floors instead of solid wood. After treating all the joists I laid a pine TG floor let it settle for a few weeks then stained it filled the gaps with a flexible outdoor sealant then several more coats of exterior grade wood stain the stuff that really stinks not a wishy washy water based one.</p>

<p>Gray has quickly become the most popular trend not just for flooring but for home decor in general. Gray cabinets gray doors you name it. Gray flooring particularly gray wood has grown exponentially over the last decade. So using hardwood flooring in a bathroom will sooner or later force you to deal with mold and mildew. Laying tile is much more time consuming and not to mention more expensive if you are hiring someone to do it.</p>

<p>Since the bathroom is the most humid room in the house youll want to go with a floor that is known for its water resistance and dimensional stability. Engineered hardwood flooring is dimensionally stable and therefore does not fluctuate too much in response to humidity so its generally best to go with engineered floors instead of solid wood. While wood is a durable choice for bathroom floors its also fantastic on the ceiling. This includes both softwoods like fir and pine and hardwoods like maple. Engineered hardwood flooring is hands-down a safer bet for bathrooms.</p>
