Its great for just spraying and mopping around to spiffy everything up but not what I would have expected to be recommended for a deep clean like Sherry wanted. After searching and searching for the best polish for hardwood floor a lot of people online were highly recommending the Bona polish so I ended up trying it.</p>

Pin On Wood Floors</p>
<p>This wood polish takes the minimum effort to apply. I think that they now use another cleaner but this one has been the best one for me using the method that I am going to share with you. Vinegar and mop and glo and all this other stuff will damage these floors. Scotts liquid gold is one of the best hardwood floor polish. Squirt it on your hardwoods and mop away to reveal clean deodorized shiny planks.</p>

<p>You can do it by yourself with a mop. Drying these floors are important because this is compressed wood and it damages it easily. For other finishes use a wax-based polish. For really dirty floors we use a drop or two of dish soap and mop and rinse then dry. Wood furniture will lose its luster over time if you forget to polish it.</p>
