If you use construction adhesive on glue-down hardwood floors you run the risk of creating such a secure bond that the wood might dislodge crack or split during seasonal moisture changes. In recent years everyone is talking about using adhesive to help with fastening wide plank floors. Gluing down your hardwood floor includes pros like giving your floors a solid feel and sound as well as being least likely to have deflection between flooring and subflooring. The NWFA guidelines state If adhesive is used with nailing follow wood andor adhesive manufacturers instructions for installing plank flooring Here is something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Glue down as an installation method for engineered and solid wood floors involves using a bonding agent adhesive or glue that you put directly on to your subfloor before laying your floor. I use 150 Pound roller on every gluedown installation. Glue-assist or just nail-down. Gluing down your hardwood floor includes pros like giving your floors a solid feel and sound as well as being least likely to have deflection between flooring and subflooring. So T moldings are not required.</p>
