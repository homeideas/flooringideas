Its easier to run flooring that exists in the other rooms of the house through to the bathroom. Yes the answer is yes you can put a hardwood floor in the bathroom. It also helps that wood floors are warmer underfoot.</p>

<p>We dont recommend solid wood floors in bathrooms with full showers or bathtubs just because wood and water dont mix. And it creates a flow a feeling of continuity that I find calming. If you do install hardwood in a bathroom you can expect increased care and maintenance to go along with it. Solid hardwood flooring will absorb moisture whether it is from high humidity or water spilled onto it. Choose an engineered pre-finished wood.</p>
