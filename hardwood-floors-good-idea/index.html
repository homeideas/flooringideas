<p>Hardwood flooring is a good choice for your kitchen if you can afford it are willing to be diligent about caring for it and want the appeal of wholly natural flooring material. Solid wood flooring is a piece of wood straight from the tree. Wood manufacturers have to keep things interesting trendy and up-to-date if they want to stay in the game. I have often said that I wish we didnt have hardwood flooring in the kitchen. We tend to think that if you go with a well-sealed hardwood less prone to scratching and dents stay away from pine and cedar in other words then wood floors are a timeless choice youll never regret.</p>
