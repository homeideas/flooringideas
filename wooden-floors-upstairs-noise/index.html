<p>Short of that placing a dense sound barrier in the open joist spaces between the floors is the most effective way to slow the transmission of noise. Noise transmission can occur horizontally if wood or laminate floor finishes are able to touch the shared party wall between the houses. Over time the nails that are holding your floor together may loosen and rub against the wood. But its always best to reduce the noise as close to the source as possible so if the upstairs is part of your own house or is under your control thats definitely the first place to put the effort. Carpeting is usually less expensive than hardwood.</p>
