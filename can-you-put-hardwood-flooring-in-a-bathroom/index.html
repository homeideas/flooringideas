<p>Installation of Laminate Flooring in the Bathroom - YouTube. For engineered hardwood costs can be as little as 3 per square foot to as high as 13 depending on the type of wood the thickness of the veneer and the quality of the finish. You can test if the finish layer is still intact by dropping a small amount of water on it and waiting to see if the water beads up or is absorbed into the wood. If you are looking for a wood look in your bathroom the best choice is a vinyl floor which is water proof and slip resistant. And yes wood flooring in the bathroom is risky.</p>

<p>Older houses pre-1980s have wooden floor joists covered with pine floorboards. With that said here are some reasons you may choose to do your half bath with laminate. It may be hard to imagine but vinyl planks are more durable than engineered hardwood in the long run. Moisture kills hardwood and a bathroom is probably the most humid area of the entire home. The wood itself just sitting there wont be harmed by steamy air once or twice every day and the occasional splash of water.</p>
