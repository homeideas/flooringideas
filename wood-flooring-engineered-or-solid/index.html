In the right circumstances an engineered floor can bring all the best qualities of solid wood floors to a space in the house where you might not have been able to use wood. The simplest way to tell the difference between the two types of wood is to pick up a loose plank. If it is one solid piece of wood with a continuous grain its solid hardwood.</p>

Difference Between Solid Wood Flooring Engineered Wood Flooring Lamin Engineered Wood Floors Wood Laminate Solid Wood Flooring</p>
<p>Whereas a solid wood floor has a wear layer that is useable above the tongue and is normally 6mm thick engineered wear layers can range from the 6 mm to 2 mm. In this case solid hardwood may be a better choice. Wider boards will give your home an open plan look and makes it feel more spacious. However engineered timber floors can have wider floorboards over 100mm wide because theyre more stable than solid wood floors. Refinishing Opportunities One of the biggest knocks against hardwood flooring is that it can be easily damaged.</p>

<p>It generally is 34 in thickness. But engineered wood is simply a veneer for your floor. The simplest way to tell the difference between the two types of wood is to pick up a loose plank. As the name implies solid hardwood is solid wood all the way through. Although engineered flooring can be a good choice for basements or over concrete slabs solid wood is the more durable long-lasting and historically appropriate option for any old-house space.</p>
