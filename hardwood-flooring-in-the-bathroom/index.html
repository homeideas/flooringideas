<p>Best Hardwood Flooring for the Bathroom. However new finishes for hardwood flooring and creative designs are making wood floors in bathrooms a viable option. Of all hardwood flooring options engineered is a better choice for a bathroom than solid as plywood or solid wood bottom layers hold up against moisture relatively well and are very dimensionally stable. Since the bathroom is the most humid room in the house youll want to go with a floor that is known for its water resistance and dimensional stability. As far as the visual aspect we love the warmth that hardwood gives a bathroom.</p>
