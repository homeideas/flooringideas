<p>So yes great for keeping clean. Before committing to either floor type spend some time looking into the pricing of both options. Even though it costs more than laminate flooring or carpet it will last so much longer so that in the long run it will actually cost less. While the warmth coziness and sound-dampening qualities of carpeting are quite popular in bedrooms many homeowners are now removing carpeting in bedrooms to either expose the existing hardwood or lay solid hardwood or engineered hardwood planks during remodeling projects. A home with continuous hardwood flooring THROUGHOUT is highly valued.</p>

So dont rip up carpets and replace them with hardwood floors just yet at least not as long as theyre in good condition. The carpeted stairs provided padding when they were learning to climb. If carpet is in the bedroom and in good condition then thats ok. The choice thats right for you will ultimately come down to how much youre willing to spend and whether you prefer the soft feel of carpet beneath your feet or the beautiful timeless look of timber.</p>
