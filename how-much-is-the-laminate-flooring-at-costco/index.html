<p>When making your choice consider your current furniture and the look of your home. The vinyl flooring was installed at almost the same time as the laminate an under normal use also looks brand new today but I can tell you for sure it is not as scratch resistant as the laminate from Costco. Golden Arowarna Vinyl Plank Flooring 2999 a case at Costco. Great for Residential and Commercial Indoor and Outdoor Applications. With so many laminates crafted in other parts of the world its nice to know you can still buy American-made flooring.</p>
